An unintrusive, lightweight tool to make writing PureScript nicer.

Currently needs the unreleased master branch of the purescript compiler to be on
your path.

### Installation

`npm i -g pscid`

### Usage

Your project needs to have been built at least once. Then: `pscid` in your projects root folder.

pscid will show you errors and warnings (one at a time) in whatever file you edit+save.
